/**
 * A stage is a set of independent tasks all computing the same function that need to run as part
 * of a Spark job, where all the tasks have the same shuffle dependencies. Each DAG of tasks run
 * by the scheduler is split up into stages at the boundaries where shuffle occurs, and then the
 * DAGScheduler runs these stages in topological order.
 *
 * Each Stage can either be a shuffle map stage, in which case its tasks' results are input for
 * another stage, or a result stage, in which case its tasks directly compute the action that
 * initiated a job (e.g. count(), save(), etc). For shuffle map stages, we also track the nodes
 * that each output partition is on.
 *
 * Each Stage also has a jobId, identifying the job that first submitted the stage.  When FIFO
 * scheduling is used, this allows Stages from earlier jobs to be computed first or recovered
 * faster on failure.
